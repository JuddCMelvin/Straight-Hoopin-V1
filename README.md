Straight Hoopin'
Straight Hoopin' is a simple basketball game where players aim to shoot as many balls into the basket as possible within a limited time frame.

How to Play
Starting the Game: Click the "Start Game" button to begin the game. Once the game starts, you'll see the shot clock counting down from 30 seconds.

Shooting: Use the arrow keys (← and →) to move the player's hand left and right. Press the spacebar to shoot the ball towards the basket.

Scoring: Each successful shot increases your score. The collision counter displayed on the scoreboard increments with each successful shot.

Game Over: The game ends when the shot clock reaches zero. Different messages will display on the result section based on your performance:

If your score is less than or equal to 5, you'll get the message "You Lost us the Game."
If your score is between 10 and 14, you'll receive the message "You're alright I guess."
If your score is 15 or more, you'll be praised with the message "You were Hoopin'!"
Reset: If you want to play again, simply click the "Reset" button to reload the game.

Bug/Unfinished

I wanted to implement a way to stop the player from continuing to shoot after the clock reaches zero but wasn't able to. 

Additionally there a few stretch goals I wanted to complete but didn't have time such as, adding sound and more game functionalaity i.e. bonus points, three-ball, etc.
